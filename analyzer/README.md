# Analyzer Component

The Analyzer component is responsible for analyzing the processed data from the Extractor component and generating insights and metrics.

## Structure

```
analyzer/
├── analyzer.py    # Main analyzer implementation
└── README.md     # This documentation file
```

## ProductAnalyzer Class

The `analyzer.py` file contains the `ProductAnalyzer` class, which is responsible for:

1. Loading processed data from the Extractor component
2. Analyzing product descriptions, prices, and other attributes
3. Generating readability scores, sentiment analysis, and other metrics
4. Identifying patterns and insights in the data
5. Saving the analysis results for reporting

### Key Features

- **Text Analysis**: Readability scores, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction
- **Price Analysis**: Statistical analysis of product pricing
- **Content Quality Analysis**: Assessment of description completeness and quality
- **SEO Analysis**: Evaluation of SEO elements like meta descriptions, headings, etc.
- **Specification Analysis**: Analysis of product specifications and attributes
- **Image Analysis**: Assessment of product image availability and quality

### Usage

The analyzer can be used as follows:

```python
from analyzer.analyzer import ProductAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = ProductAnalyzer(
    input_dir="data/processed",
    output_dir="data/analyzed"
)

# Analyze a file
output_file = analyzer.analyze_file("processed_data.json")

print(f"Analysis results saved to: {output_file}")
```

## NLP Components

The analyzer uses several Natural Language Processing (NLP) components:

- **NLTK**: For tokenization, stopword removal, and basic text processing
- **spaCy**: For more advanced NLP tasks like entity recognition and dependency parsing
- **textstat**: For calculating readability metrics

These components are initialized when the analyzer is created and used throughout the analysis process.

## Customization

The analyzer component can be customized by:

1. Modifying the analysis methods to change how data is analyzed
2. Adding new analysis techniques for specific types of data
3. Adjusting the scoring and interpretation functions
4. Extending the `ProductAnalyzer` class to support different analysis approaches

## Integration

The Analyzer component is designed to work seamlessly with the other components of the Generic AI Audit Agent:

- It takes input from the **Extractor** component
- It provides output to the **Reporter** component
- It is orchestrated by the main application

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the Analyzer component include:

- Advanced sentiment analysis using machine learning models
- Competitive analysis comparing products across different websites
- Trend analysis over time
- Anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns
- Integration with external data sources for enriched analysis
